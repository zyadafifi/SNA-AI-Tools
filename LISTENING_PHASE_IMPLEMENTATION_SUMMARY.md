## Technical Implementation Details

### Mobile Detection

- Added responsive breakpoint at 768px
- Separate rendering logic for mobile vs desktop
- Event listeners for window resize to handle orientation changes

### Progress Tracking

- Top progress bar shows course-level progress using ProgressBar component
- Bottom progress bar shows video playback progress
- Timer-based progress tracking (since YouTube iframe doesn't provide reliable progress events)

### Video Handling

- **Current Implementation**: Using YouTube iframe with autoplay parameter
- **Limitation**: YouTube iframe has limited control for mobile full-screen experience
- **Progress Tracking**: Timer-based estimation using lesson.duration field
- **Auto-transition**: Triggers after estimated video duration completes

### Styling Approach

- Mobile-first design with full-screen layouts
- iOS safe area support (notches, home indicators)
- Gradient backgrounds matching SNA brand colors (#ffc515, #ffd84d, #cc6a15)
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Video Source Limitation

**Current State**: Using YouTube iframe which has these limitations:

- Limited control over playback on mobile
- Can't reliably detect video end/progress
- Using timer-based estimation instead

**Recommended Improvement**:

- Convert to direct MP4 video sources for better mobile control
- Use HTML5 video element with subtitle support
- Implement proper video progress tracking
- Add subtitle synchronization using SRT files (infrastructure exists in pronunciation tool)

### Subtitle Integration (Not Yet Implemented)

The plan mentioned subtitle overlay, but this requires:

- Direct video sources (not YouTube iframe)
- SRT subtitle files for each lesson
- Integration with `useSubtitleSync` hook
- Currently, YouTube's built-in subtitles are used instead
